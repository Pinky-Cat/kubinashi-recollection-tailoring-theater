Mod is WIP.

To apply the mod, use a xdelta patcher and patch the data.win of version 1.02c of Kubinashi Recollection with the Tailoring Theater.xdelta file.

To locate the custom level, there will be a door added next to the starting area in the Dream World that leads to the world of Tailoring Theater.

The additional Export_Rooms folder contains a room with most objects of the game in one room to avoid the slow search and loading process when editing with [UTM:CE](https://github.com/XDOneDude/UndertaleModToolCE). Use ImportRoomsBulk.csx under Resource Unpackers scripts to import the room into data.win as many times as needed.

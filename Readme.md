# Kubinashi Recollection Custom Level Mod - Tailoring Theater 

## Description

This mod adds a new door next to Doremy Sweet in the Dream World that leads to the new world of Tailoring Theater.
Note that this mod is still work in progress with more levels to be created in the future.

## Installation

To apply the mod, use a xdelta patcher and patch the data.win of version 1.02c of Kubinashi Recollection with the Tailoring Theater.xdelta file.

## Editing

The additional Export_Rooms folder contains a room with most objects of the game in one room to avoid the slow search and loading process when editing levels with [UTM:CE](https://github.com/XDOneDude/UndertaleModToolCE). Use ImportRoomsBulk.csx under Resource Unpackers scripts to import the room into data.win as many times as needed.
